Background Color Changer
This is a simple React project where the background color of the page changes when you click on one of the color buttons. Each button represents a color, and when clicked, it will update the page's background color accordingly.

Features
Dynamic Background Change: Clicking a button changes the background color of the entire page.
Button Highlighting: The clicked button’s text color changes to match the selected background color.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bg-changer.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd bg-changer
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Click on any color button, and the background will change to that color. The clicked button's text color will also change to match the selected color.

Code Explanation
State Management: The project uses useState to track two things:
The background color of the page.
The button that is currently clicked (to change its text color).
Dynamic Buttons: The color buttons are generated using the map function for simplicity and scalability.
Example
Here’s what the buttons look like:

Red: Changes the background to red and turns the button text red.
Blue: Changes the background to blue and turns the button text blue.

Background Color Changer
This project is a simple React app that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking different color buttons. Each button represents a color, and clicking it will change the background to the respective color.

Features

Multiple Colors: Includes options like red, blue, green, yellow, white, black, pink, and olive.
Responsive Design: The button layout is responsive and centered at the bottom of the screen.
Installation

Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd bg-color-changer

Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Click on any of the color buttons to change the background color of the page.

Code Explanation
useState Hook:

We use the useState hook to manage the background color of the page. The initial color is set to black ("Black"), and it changes when a button is clicked.
Color Buttons:

Each button has an onClick event handler that triggers the setColor function with a specific color. For example, clicking the red button will call setColor("red"), and the page background changes to red.
Tailwind CSS:

The project uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The buttons are styled with colors, padding, and rounded corners for a sleek appearance.
Example
Here’s what the buttons do:

Red: Changes the background to red.
Blue: Changes the background to blue.
Green: Changes the background to green.
Yellow: Changes the background to yellow.
White: Changes the background to white.
Black: Changes the background to black.
Pink: Changes the background to pink.
Olive: Changes the background to olive green.
Dependencies
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
